**Mongo Replication**

A MongoDB replica set is a group of interconnected separate instances of MongoDB that work together as one to provide high availability and fault tolerance. In a replica set, one node is elected as the primary to handle write operations while the rest serve as secondaries and replicate its data. In case of a primary node failure, a secondary node steps up to take over as the new primary, guaranteeing high availability.
